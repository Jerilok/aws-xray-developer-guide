# AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Python<a name="xray-python-opentel-sdk"></a>

With the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry \(ADOT\) Python, you can instrument your applications once and send correlated metrics and traces to multiple AWS monitoring solutions including Amazon CloudWatch, AWS X\-Ray, and Amazon OpenSearch Service\. Using X\-Ray with ADOT requires two components: an *OpenTelemetry SDK* enabled for use with X\-Ray, and the *AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector* enabled for use with X\-Ray\. ADOT Python includes auto\-instrumentation support, enabling your application to send traces without code changes\.

To get started, see the [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Python documentation](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/python-sdk)\.

For more information about using the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry with AWS X\-Ray and other AWS services, see [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry](https://aws-otel.github.io/) or the [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Documentation](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/introduction)\.
