# Getting started with X\-Ray<a name="xray-gettingstarted"></a>

To get started with AWS X\-Ray:
+ Launch a [sample application](xray-scorekeep.md) that is already instrumented to generate trace data\. In a few minutes, you can launch the sample app, generate traffic, send segments to X\-Ray, and view a service map and traces in the AWS Management Console\.
+ Learn how to [instrument your application](xray-instrumenting-your-app.md), including using the X\-Ray SDKs or the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry to send trace data to X\-Ray\.
+ Explore other [AWS services](xray-services.md) that are integrated with X\-Ray, including sampling and adding headers to incoming requests, running the X\-Ray daemon, and automatically sending trace data to X\-Ray\.
+ Use the [X\-Ray API](xray-api.md), which provides access to all X\-Ray functionality through the AWS SDK, AWS Command Line Interface, or directly over HTTPS\.
