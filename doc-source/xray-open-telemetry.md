# AWS X\-Ray with the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry<a name="xray-open-telemetry"></a>

The AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry is an AWS distribution based on the Cloud Native Computing \(CNCF\) OpenTelemetry project\. OpenTelemetry provides a single set of open source APIs, libraries, and agents to collect distributed traces and metrics\. This toolkit is a distribution of upstream OpenTelemetry components including SDKs, auto\-instrumentation agents, and collectors that are tested, optimized, secured, and supported by AWS\. With the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry, engineers can instrument their applications once and send correlated metrics and traces to multiple AWS monitoring solutions including Amazon CloudWatch, AWS X\-Ray, and Amazon Elasticsearch Service\. The AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry includes support for Java, Python, Go, and JavaScript with an auto\-instrumentation agent in Java\.

Much like using AWS X\-Ray, using X\-Ray with OpenTelemetry requires two components: an *OpenTelemetry SDK* enabled for use with X\-Ray, and the *AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector* enabled for use with X\-Ray\.

For more information about using the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry with AWS X\-Ray and other AWS services, see [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry](https://aws-otel.github.io/) or the [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Documentation](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/introduction)\.
