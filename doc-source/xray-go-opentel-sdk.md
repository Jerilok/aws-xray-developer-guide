# AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Go<a name="xray-go-opentel-sdk"></a>

With the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Go, you can instrument your applications once and send correlated metrics and traces to multiple AWS monitoring solutions including Amazon CloudWatch, AWS X\-Ray, and Amazon OpenSearch Service\. Using X\-Ray with AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry requires two components: an *OpenTelemetry SDK* enabled for use with X\-Ray, and the *AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector* enabled for use with X\-Ray\.

To get started, see the [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Go documentation](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/go-sdk)\.
